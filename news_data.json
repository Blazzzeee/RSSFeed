    "description": "Korea's business sentiment improved for the third straight month in May amid eased uncertainties at home and abroad, a central bank poll showed Wednesday. The Composite Business Sentiment Index (CBSI) for all industries came to 90.7 in May, up 2.8 points from the previous month, according to the survey by the Bank of Korea (BOK). It marked the first time since November that the index stayed above the long-term average of about 90. The CBSI among manufacturers climbed 1.6 points from a month earlier to 94.7 in May, and that among nonmanufacturers went up 3.6 points to 88.1. The index measures corporate prospects for business conditions. A reading below 100 means pessimists outnumber optimists. Business sentiment had deteriorated since late last year, hitting the lowest level in about 4 1/2 years of 85.3 in February, due mainly to former President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law and uncertainties triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's new tariff scheme. Following the martial law imposition, Yoon was impeached in late December and formally removed from office in April, setting",

    "description": "The reigning Korean baseball MVP Kim Do-yeong has suffered yet another hamstring injury that will keep him out for several weeks, with his Kia Tigers unable to catch a break as they try to defend their league title. Kim grabbed the back of his right thigh after stealing second base during the bottom of the fifth inning against the Kiwoom Heroes on Tuesday at Gwangju-Kia Champions Field in Gwangju, some 270 kilometers south of Seoul. Immediately after his third steal of the season, Kim called for a trainer and walked off the field, with a slight limp, moments later. The initial diagnosis Tuesday night showed some damage to Kim's right hamstring. The Tigers then announced Wednesday afternoon that Kim has a grade 2 strain and he will be reevaluated four weeks later. Kim missed the first month of the season with a milder, grade 1 strain of his left hamstring. He pulled up lame after rounding first base during the season-opening game on March 22 and did not play again until April 25. And the 21-year-old superstar had been playing well before the injury. He entered Wednesday's game batting .330",

The policy booklet is comprised of three major policy visions, 15 policy tasks and 247 detailed pledges, outlining campaign promises across various sectors, which include \"restoring the constitutional order.\" For reforming the prosecution, the DPK pledged to separate its investigative and indictment powers, strengthen judicial control over abuse of indictment powers and introduce a system to dismiss prosecutors. It also formalized a pledge to increase the number of Supreme Court justices, which it says would increase public trust in the court. The DPK, however, did not offer a detailed plan on the move amid controversy over a now-withdrawn bill pushed by some DPK lawmakers that had sought to appoint non-lawyers for the court's justices and increase its bench to 100. The DPK also pledged to come up with measures for democratic control over the president's right to declare martial law, appoint a",

The country’s largest lender, KB Kookmin Bank, plans to use some of its idle branches' consultation spaces for SMEs and self-employed individuals. The consulting services are scheduled to begin in the second half of the year, in collaboration with the Small Enterprise and Market Service, a government-affiliated SME support organization. Shinhan Bank is in discussions with financial authorities to nearly double the number of its corporate support centers, which they established last year.

    "description": "The United States and China are locked in a standoff with no resolution in sight. The U.S. wants to reshore manufacturing, and China wants to sell its manufactured products into the American market. It will take a creative solution to overcome this impasse, but it’s very possible. President Donald Trump himself has already previewed what a winning formula could look like. During his 2024 campaign, he repeatedly pledged to lure other countries’ factories to the United States. At a rally in Michigan, he said: “China has to build plants here and hire our workers. When I’m back in the White House, the way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America. They have to build it in America, and they have to use you people to build it.” When China began embracing a market economy in the 1970s, its leaders made a similar demand to American companies. In order to get access to the Chinese market, American firms would have to manufacture in China, hire Chinese workers and teach the Chinese the underlying technology. But times have changed. China is no longer America’s",

During the four-day biennial event that kicked off in Busan, Wednesday, the shipbuilder is introducing 10 unmanned vessels, four surface ships and three submarines through small-scale replicas and digital mock-ups. In the unmanned systems category, the most notable exhibits include a combat unmanned underwater vehicle and a command-and-control ship designed for manned-unmanned teaming. Hanwha Ocean said the latter is a strategic asset developed to support the Republic of Korea Navy's \"smart navy\" vision and its \"Sea GHOST\" (guardian harmonized with operating manned systems and technology-based unmanned systems) concept, capable of operating and commanding a wide range of unmanned and manned assets for complex maritime missions. The surface ship lineup includes a next-generation frigate with enhanced ballistic missile defense capabilities, as well as a futuristic destroyer equipped with electric propuls",

Lee Jae-myung of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea, Kim Moon-soo of the conservative People Power Party, Lee Jun-seok of the Reform Party and Kwon Young-kook of Korean Democratic Labor Party took to the floor to discuss the political divide, reforms and foreign policy issues. The four went right at the actual content of these issues and each other's flaws and faults whether related or unrelated. In light of the past six months of political turbulence, viewers would have expected more forward-looking plans on how the candidates, if elected as the next president, would work to restore Korea's democratic functions on par with its economy and cultural prowess. To a certain extent Lee stressed \"politics of dialogue, communication, respect for others and compromise\" and Kim talked up \"politics of integration.\" Kwon pushed for ideas for banning satellite parties and forged a sort of a consensus for constitutional revision, a demand that has been widely shared in the p",

The distribution hub outside Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah had been opened the day before by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation , which has been slated by Israel to take over aid operations.

Since mainstream media coverage of Trump is so often negative, indeed, the adversarial relationship is now established, and more dispassionate evaluation becomes highly desirable. Simply by traveling to the region, especially early in his term and with so much fanfare, Trump undercuts criticism that he and his associates are domestically focused, save for tariffs. Indeed, he has encouraged this criticism by sustained rhetorical emphasis on at-home concerns and strong suspicion of foreigners, in particular in presidential campaigns. He is on record as liking the slogan “America First.” That term was popularized between the two world wars and served as the name of the powerful populist movement to preserve U.S. isolationism and promote our diplomatic distance from the rest of the world. Going to the Middle East also reinforces Trump’s presidential travel priorities. In both White House terms, he has visited S",

    "description": "SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, United States — SpaceX's prototype Starship exploded over the Indian Ocean on Tuesday, capping another bumpy test flight for the rocket central to billionaire Elon Musk's dream of colonizing Mars. The biggest and most powerful launch vehicle ever built lifted off around 6:36 pm (2336 GMT) from the company's Starbase facility, near a southern Texas village that earlier this month voted to become a city — also named Starbase. Excitement ran high among SpaceX engineers and spectators alike, after the last two outings ended with the upper stage disintegrating in fiery cascades over the Caribbean. But signs of trouble emerged quickly: the first-stage Super Heavy booster blew up instead of executing its planned splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. A live feed then showed the upper-stage spaceship failing to open its doors to deploy a payload of Starlink satellite \"simulators.\" Though the ship flew farther than on its two previous attempts, it sprang leaks and began spinning out of control as it coasted through space. Mission teams vented fuel to reduce the force of the expec",

The film, starring Bae Doona as Taek-seon, follows an unexpected journey sparked by a mysterious virus that rekindles her fading capacity to love. Chang plays Yeon-u, a key character whose grounded presence balances the film’s offbeat charm. In a recent interview, Chang recalled his initial reaction to the casting offer: “It felt so out of the blue. I hadn’t really acted before — well, I did a sitcom years ago — but I wasn’t actively thinking about acting again.” Upon reading the script, Chang realized the role was far more substantial than a cameo. He initially declined, but a call from actor and producer Kim Yoon-seok changed his mind. “Kim told me, ‘Film people don’t mess around. We’ll set the stage, just come and have fun,’” said Chang, laughing. “I mean, when else would I get to hang out with these amazing actors?” Chang, a longtime fan of both Kim and Bae, said the opportunity to work with them felt surreal at first.",

In the video, Kim appeared and spoke about his current condition. Despite being almost blind in his left eye, Kim participated in a martial arts match to raise funds for charity. However, the injury led to the collapse of his eyeball. \"I can’t see out of my left eye, but that eye was already damaged, so it was okay to get hit there,\" he said. \"But if my right eye gets injured, that would be a problem. So, I switched to a left-handed stance this time. By doing that, even if I got hit with a counterpunch, it would land on this side. Thankfully, my right eye wasn’t injured.\" Kim explained that his strategy was to give up protecting the already-blind left eye and focus on preserving the right one. \"Both of my eyes used to have 2.0 vision, but after the injury to my left eye, the right one also got worse. It’s around minus six now,\" he said, expressing his sadness over",

The remark, seen by critics as deeply misogynistic, prompted immediate backlash across the political and social spectrum. During the final round of live debates on Tuesday, Lee posed a graphic question to Kwon Young-kook, a candidate from the minor progressive Korean Democratic Labor Party (KDLP). \"If someone says they want to stick chopsticks into women’s genitals, would this constitute misogyny?\" Lee asked, a comment that quickly intensified accusations against him and highlighted his reputation for anti-feminist rhetoric. The 40-year-old was referring to a scandal involving Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) frontrunner Lee Jae-myung’s son, who allegedly posted misogynistic content online around 2020. Lee issued an apology for the scandal while campaigning for president in late 2021. In response, Kwon refused to answer, saying, “I don’t understand what the",

The emotional resonance of the film isn’t just felt on-screen; it echoes behind the scenes through the contributions of people like executive producer Rebecca Cho and executive music producer Serena Göransson — both of whom have roots in Korea. While the film doesn’t visually reference Korean culture, its connection to the peninsula is deeply tied to the production team. For both Cho and Göransson, bringing \"Sinners\" to Korea carries special significance — not just as professionals, but as individuals whose personal ties make the moment intimate and powerful. “For both of them having roots here and bringing a movie that very much touches on that subject, the moment for both is emotional and special for them to promote and show the movie here in Korea,” the team shared. “Both for the love and deep respect they have for the creator and how they can also relate to the s",

The Twins are still in first place in the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) but dropped to 34-19-1 (wins-losses-ties). The Eagles are now 2 1/2 games back in second place at 32-22-0. The Eagles wasted no time getting on the board, as Estevan Florial opened the game with a towering solo home run off starter Coen Wynne. The Eagles then scored three times with two outs in the top third. With a man at second, Ha Ju-suk singled up the middle for a 2-0 lead. Moon Hyun-bin then lined a double to the right field for a 3-0 advantage, and came home to make it 4-0 on a single by Roh Si-hwan. Eagles starter Cody Ponce retired the first 10 batters he faced, but the first hit he gave up left t",

    "description": "Undersea cables are responsible for carrying approximately 99 percent of global data transmissions. Whether by accident, negligence or mischief, any damage to these cables can significantly disrupt communication systems. As submarine cables traverse multiple maritime zones, they fall under varied jurisdictions, complicating efforts to secure them. Steps to probe and prosecute the actors behind cable cuts are constrained by capacity and legal gaps. Nonetheless, in this interconnected world, even localized cable ruptures can have wider ripple effects. Thus, it takes a village to protect our critical underwater infrastructure. In contrast to the crucial role played by undersea cables is their vulnerability and the weak consequences for impairing them. Reparations for cable cuts imposed on a ship that carries a flag of convenience are low despite the substantial disruption brought about by the damage — let alone the difficulty of attributing legal responsibility or policing all suspicious activities in a vast ocean. These characteristics make undersea cables particularly attractive targ",

According to the Korea Automobile & Mobility Association (KAMA), only 18 hydrogen vehicles, including both passenger and commercial models, were exported from January to April, down 70 percent from 60 units a year ago. Domestic sales came to 965 units over the cited period, raising concerns that the annual tally may dip to the lowest in years. Hyundai Motor, which had led the global hydrogen vehicle market with models like the Nexo and the Xcient commercial truck, is losing momentum due to limited model availability and a lack of hydrogen infrastructure. Exports peaked at 1,121 units in 2021 following the launch of the Nexo in 2018 but have since declined. Domestic sales also fell from a high of 10,328 units in 2022 to 4,707 in 2023 and 3,787 last year.

The urgent appeals reflect growing concerns that many voters may take advantage of the long weekend by taking Monday off and extending their break through Election Day on Tuesday, which could significantly reduce turnout on the official polling day. Lee Jae-myung, the candidate of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), has emphasized the importance of early voting and is urging his supporters to vote in advance. He will cast his early ballot in Seoul on Thursday, according to Rep. Jo Seoung-lae, chief spokesperson for the party’s election committee. The DPK is framing the upcoming election as a referendum on former President Yoon Suk Yeol's Dec. 3 martial law declaration, urging broad voter participation. Since early voting typically sees higher turnout among liberal voters, the party is intensifying efforts to energize and mobilize its core supporters. \"The record-breaking t",

A total of 21,041 babies were born in March, up 6.8 percent from 19,694 babies born a year earlier, according to the data compiled by Statistics Korea. The upward trend in births has continued since July 2024, the agency said. It also marked the first time in 10 years that the number of babies born in March increased on-year. In the first quarter of 2025, the number of newborns rose 7.4 percent from a year before to 65,022, marking the largest on-year increase for any first quarter since the agency began compiling relevant data in 1981. It also represents the highest number of first-quarter births in three years, after 68,339 recorded in the first quarter of 2022. The country's total fertility rate, the average number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime, also rose by 0.05 from a year earlier to 0.82 in the January-March period, largely due to increased childbirths among women in their 30s. \"W",

The bank had previously offered limited sales of these currencies at its exchange counter in Incheon International Airport, but the services will now be fully discontinued. The bank attributed the decision to the growing supply instability. Hana Bank and KB Kookmin Bank already suspended exchange services for these currencies last year. That leaves Shinhan Bank as the only commercial bank in Korea still offering exchange services — albeit limited — for these three currencies.

Meant to hurt the frontrunning mayoral candidate weeks before the Democratic primary, it may actually help the former governor. Remember, this is the same Trump DOJ that moved to end the prosecution against Eric Adams to avoid “improperly interfer[ing] with Mayor Adams’ campaign in the 2025 mayoral election.” However, that investigation had begun even before Adams was elected mayor four years ago. The meritless Cuomo inquiry comes from a referral by openly partisan House Oversight Chair Rep. James Comer, who accused Cuomo of lying to his committee about the former governor’s handling of the COVID. That same referral was rejected last fall, but Trump’s new politicized officials, like Attorney General Pam Bondi, DOJ No. 3 Emil Bove and Trump’s first, failed pick for the U.S. attorney in D.C., Ed Martin, ignored departmental rules and acted on it.

The decision put on hold a general strike the union had threatened to stage early Wednesday morning if negotiations collapsed, with city officials confirming that bus services were running normally as of 4 a.m. A union official said the union wanted to avoid a \"meaningless\" strike, having concluded that a walkout would do little to shift the positions of the employers and the city. The union plans to resume negotiations after taking necessary legal and administrative actions.

It’s a meditation on tragedy, love, family and the enduring search for freedom. Set in 1932 Mississippi, the film opens with Sammie Miller, played by breakout talent Miles Caton, rushing into his father’s church, bloodied and clutching part of a broken guitar. His father, a preacher, begs him to abandon the blues — the “devil’s music” — but Sammie clings tightly to both his father and his instrument. This tense scene, though short, already expresses themes such as religion, spirituality, self-expression and freedom that are seen throughout the movie. A flashback transports us to the day before, when the “Smokestack twins” — Elijah \"Smoke\" Moore and Elias \"Stack\" Moore, both played by Michael B. Jordan — return from Chicago, ready to open a juke joint in their hometown. Jordan gives a remarka",

According to the band's agency, KQ Entertainment, the group will release its 12th EP, \"GOLDEN HOUR: Part.3,\" on June 13. The comeback marks the band's first new release in about seven months, following November 2024's \"GOLDEN HOUR: Part.2.\" The \"Part.2\" album achieved notable global success, topping the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S. and reaching No. 4 on the U.K.'s Official Albums Chart. Their second full-length album, \"THE WORLD EP FIN : WILL,\" also secured first place on the Billboard 200 late last year, raising expectations for another strong chart performance with the new release. If the upcoming release also lands atop the Billboard 200, it will mark ATEEZ's third No. 1 on the chart — an achievement only two other K-pop boy bands, BTS and Stray Kids, have accomplished. ATEEZ also will kick off its \"2025 World Tour: In Your Fantasy\" with two nights at Inspire Arena on Yeongjong Island, Incheon, on July 5 a",

PPP presidential candidate Kim Moon-soo has tried to persuade the RP's Lee to field a single candidate to better challenge Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) candidate Lee Jae-myung, the campaign's front-runner. However, the RP's Lee has declared he would not drop his candidacy until Election Day and the two-day early voting period for the June 3 vote will begin on Thursday. \"The candidacy unification issue no longer seems to be something that can be resolved by mechanically setting a deadline,\" PPP spokesperson Shin Dong-wook told reporters. \"The stage where we can resolve this through negotiations and contact has already passed,\" Shin said, while appealing to the RP candidate to consider the broader national interest. A poll by Realmeter released earlier in the day showed the DPK's Lee leading with 49.2 percent — more than the combined support for Kim at 36.8 percent and Lee",

Both Seoul and Washington have denied the report, with the Pentagon calling it \"not true\" and reaffirming that America remains \"fully\" committed to the defense of South Korea and strengthening the alliance.

The incident occurred on May 9 during class, when the student, identified as A, kicked their homeroom teacher B in the knee and verbally abused them. The student had a history of struggling to accept mistakes. The teacher was placed on special leave and temporarily replaced by a substitute, but A continued to disrupt class and allegedly threatened the replacement teacher. The school’s response has drawn criticism. The KTU accused the school of failing to protect the assaulted teacher and instead pressuring them to meet with the student’s parents. “This lack of separation and healing, combined with the expectation that teachers deal with complaints, amounts to secondary victimization,” the union said.

However, the timing of the new policy raises questions, given the platform’s underwhelming performance in the local streaming market.

Under the revised policy, only those residing at the same address may share an account, and access will be limited to devices associated with the user’s primary residence. Users who wish to share their account with individuals outside their household will be able to do so by paying an additional monthly fee to add extra members. Disney+ began restricting password sharing in certain countries last year, introducing paid sharing subscriptions. The company explained that the crackdown in Korea is part of implementing its account policy change worldwide. \"(Password-sharing restrictions) are already being implemented globally and it is simply Korea's turn in the sequence,” a Disney+ Korea official said.

Batting cleanup, Lee was hit by starter Jack Flaherty's knuckle curve in the top of the first inning. And that ended up being the only time Lee reached base in this game. He grounded out in the fourth inning and again in the seventh inning. In the top of the ninth, the Giants scored a run to cut the Tigers' lead to 3-1. Lee then stepped in with no out and a runner at second, but flied out to left fielder Riley Greene, who made a sliding catch. The seven-game run was tied for the second-longest hitting streak this season for Lee, who had an eight-game streak from late March to early April. He is now batting .281, and he still leads the Giants with 59 hits and 14 doubles.

As of the first quarter of 2025, the average delinquency rate across Korea’s five major regional banks — BNK Kyongnam, BNK Busan, Kwangju, Jeonbuk and Jeju — reached 1.14 percent. This marks the highest figure since the third quarter of 2010 and nearly triples the rate recorded at major commercial banks.

    "description": "Korean composing prodigy Lee Hanurij, born in 2006, is quickly gaining recognition for his abstract, sound-driven compositions that challenge expectations. From pianist Lim Yun-chan’s recent recitals in Korea and abroad to upcoming performances by the Seoul Metropolitan Traditional Orchestra, his works are being featured at some of the country’s most high-profile classical events. In an interview held at the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts on May 23, the 19-year-old shared his artistic philosophy: “I don’t compose to express a meaning or concept. I’m more interested in exploring the intrinsic possibilities of each instrument and the acoustic relationships between them.” Lee began his musical journey at the age of 4, learning piano and violin. A turning point came in elementary school when he first heard the second movement of Scriabin’s \"Piano Sonata No. 3.\" Moved by the experience, he began scribbling on manuscript paper instead of practicing, prompting his parents to encourage him to pursue composition more seriously. In 2016, he joined the gifted program at the Seou",

    "description": "Karina of K-pop girl group aespa faced online criticism after posting a photo wearing a jacket with a red number ‘2,’ stirring political controversy just days ahead of the June 3 presidential election. Karina shared a casual photo on Instagram taken on a street in Japan, captioned simply with a rose emoji, Tuesday. In the image, she was seen wearing a black jacket adorned with diagonal red stripes and a bold red number “2.” Her face was mostly hidden behind the jacket's zipper as she struck a playful pose. The post soon went viral on online communities under the title “Karina’s recent update,” prompting speculation that the idol was subtly endorsing a particular political candidate — specifically, the No. 2 candidate represented by the conservative People Power Party, which uses red as its campaign color. The photo has since been deleted from her account. Some netizens commented, “She must be a patriotic conservative,” “Karina is No. 2 for sure” and “I’m a fan starting today.” Netizens argued that the post was tone-deaf in light of the upcoming election, with",

    "description": "Google has once again requested permission from the Korean government to transfer the country’s 1:5,000-scale high-precision map data to its overseas data centers. Currently, the company relies on lower-resolution 1:25,000-scale maps, alongside aerial and satellite imagery, to provide mapping services in Korea. This third request — the first since 2016 — carries added significance, coming just a month after U.S. President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, whose administration labeled the restriction as a “nontariff barrier.” Amid Trump’s threats to impose hefty tariffs on Korea, some experts suggest that the government consider leveraging the issue of high-precision map data transfers as a barging chip in trade negotiations with Washington. However, the matter should not be addressed solely under trade pressure. High-precision maps are critical infrastructure for emerging spatial information industries, such as autonomous driving, augmented reality (AR) and digital twins, closely linked to national security and industrial competitiveness.

    "description": "After years of criticism over a policy vacuum, Korea’s presidential candidates are finally addressing tourism in their platforms — recognizing the industry’s potential as a key driver of economic growth and national prosperity. This renewed focus underscores a critical recognition: A vibrant tourism sector is not merely about leisure, but a potent engine for economic diversification, job creation and cultural diplomacy. Neglecting this industry risks squandering a significant opportunity to bolster national revenue and enhance Korea's global soft power, particularly as the nation seeks to navigate a complex post-pandemic economic landscape. Kim Moon-soo of the conservative People Power Party (PPP) vowed Tuesday to “elevate Korea’s tourism to a national strategic industry” and pledged to develop five major \"K-pop cities\" to draw in foreign visitors. At a press conference held at the party’s headquarters in Seoul, he unveiled a set of tourism pledges spanning a range of themes.

The KCS and the Korea Coast Guard launched a joint investigation based on this tip-off. Investigators have identified eight crew members as allegedly being involved in the smuggling operation.

    "description": "In 1990 when I arrived in Korea, I discovered that singing was practically a national pastime. I knew about karaoke in Japan, but I had no idea that Koreans had put their own spin on the phenomenon with something called noraebang. Translated literally, it means “singing room” (norae = “song,” bang = “room”), and in the early 1990s, these places were popping up on almost every corner. Here's a brief backstory: The concept of karaoke is generally credited to Japan, where, in the 1970s, Daisuke Inoue popularized the first coin-operated karaoke machines. Korea quickly adopted this technology by creating the private-room format — unlike the large, open-bar settings that are more typical in the West, the noraebang offers you and your friends a personal space to sing your hearts out. The idea surged in popularity partly because it aligned perfectly with social culture in Korea, where going out in groups — friends, coworkers, classmates — has been (and still is) a common way to unwind and connect. When I first arrived, noraebangs had small booths with karaoke machines, plus a",

In detail, the country's external financial assets came to a record high of $2.52 trillion as of end-March, up $4.2 billion from a year earlier, on the back of increased stock investments and investment returns. The external financial debt rose $22.2 billion from three months earlier to $1.43 trillion, the data showed.",

    "description": "Korean companies are increasingly being pressed to make payments in Chinese yuan when importing goods from China, as Beijing exerts increasing influence in global trade and seeks to undermine the dominance of the U.S. dollar, according to experts, Wednesday. Korean exporters still mostly take dollars from Chinese buyers. But the Chinese currency can be used more frequently in long-term transactions if the greenback becomes weaker due to U.S. tariff policies and unstable monetary measures, they said. The Bank of Korea (BOK) data showed yuan has gradually yet persistently increased its share among currencies used in Korean import payments. Its share was merely 0.8 percent in 2018 but went up to 1.1 percent in 2019. The ratio was measured at 1.5 percent in 2020 and 2021 and then climbed to 1.7 percent in 2022, 2.4 percent in 2023 and currently is about 3.1 percent. Accordingly, the total value of yuan-based import payments reached $19.5 billion in 2024, marking a nearly eightfold increase from $2.5 billion in 2014. The findings came as the yuan has overtaken the euro as the world’s second",
