Six dance crews from Korea, the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are set to face off as national representatives, with communication transcending language as dancers rely on movement to connect, compete and captivate. At a press conference Tuesday in southern Seoul, the show's chief producer Choi Jeong-nam said the decision to turn the show into a global showdown came after seeing the impact of overseas participation in Season 2. \"When international crews joined in the second season of 'SWF,' we realized how much more we could introduce global dancers to our fans,\" Choi said. \"That's why we brought in crews from around the world for this season.\" Choi said the shift did bring its share of challenges, especially in communication and cultural differences. \"We had translators for English and Japanese.

Otherwise known as a reverse mortgage, this financial product allows homeowners to borrow against their home’s equity and receive monthly lifetime payouts. It helps older adults supplement their reduced income after retirement, but it results in a smaller inheritance for their children. The product was developed jointly by Hana Bank and Hana Life. It is available to people aged 55 and older. It is a nonrecourse product, meaning the heirs do not inherit debt even if the subscribers die and their home sells for lower than the loan balance. The lender bears the difference between the original price and the market price. If the home sells for higher than the loan balance, the heirs are able to inherit the difference. Hana said the product will be available at a fixed rate of 3.95 percent for long-term security. The lender said the product will offer many older customers better postretirement planning. “Korea’s second b",

In Korea, a baseball game is as much about the food as it is about the sport — and maybe even more. To see what makes Korean stadium culture so special, Howdy Korea host Yasmin headed to Incheon’s SSG Landers Field with In-soo, a longtime fan of the Landers baseball team. What unfolded was a full-blown cultural festival, complete with sizzling grills, overflowing platters, team chants and the kind of culinary surprises that have to be seen — and tasted — to be believed.

In \"The Devil’s Plan: Death Room,\" players from various professions live together for seven days to determine the ultimate mastermind.

The annual \"Flag March\" drew tens of thousands of people, chanting, dancing and waving Israeli flags after far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir visited the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, a longtime flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian tensions. Violence broke out in the walled Old City of East Jerusalem shortly after midday, a Reuters witness said, when young marchers began harassing the few Palestinian shopkeepers who had yet to shutter their stores ahead of the rally. The marchers, mostly young Israelis who live in settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, then began to target Israeli left-wing activists and journalists observing the rally. The demonstrators shouted nationalistic slogans and called for violence against Palestinians, chanting: “Death to Arabs.” A Palestinian woman and journalists were spat on by a group of young s",

The Korea Football Association (KFA) said Lee, 51, will be in charge of the 2026 Asian Games and, if Korea qualify, the 2028 Summer Olympics. Both tournaments are open to players 23 years old or younger, with each team allowed to carry up to three overage players. Lee earned 67 caps for Korea as a defender and represented the country at the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups. Though he only scored twice in his international career, one of them made him a household name. In a World Cup qualifying match against Japan in Tokyo on Sept. 28, 1997, Lee netted the go-ahead goal in the 86th minute to lift Korea to a 2-1 victory. After his playing career ended, Lee began his coaching career in 2010, and went on to work with clubs in China and Korea. In 2018, Lee was the top assistant for the Korean U-23 men's national team that won the Asian Games gold medal in Indonesia.

    "description": "Leading presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung’s recent invocation of Park Chung-hee in economic discourse is more than a rhetorical flourish. By aligning himself with Park’s legacy of state-led development and industrialization, Lee is signaling a strategic shift toward the political center. This move suggests recognition that ideological purity has diminishing utility amid mounting economic anxieties. It also underscores the enduring resonance of Park’s mythos in the Korean political imagination, particularly among older and centrist voters who associate him with modernization, if not democratization. Lee’s pivot to moderation is evident throughout his evolving economic platform. The once-central promise of a universal basic income — a hallmark of his 2022 presidential campaign — has quietly faded into the background. Pressured by inflation, fiscal constraints and criticism from both conservatives and cautious progressives, Lee has replaced grand redistribution with more targeted welfare and industrial policies. These changes align with broader global post-pandemic priorit",

Although Yoon is not running this time, his martial law fiasco continues to haunt the conservative People Power Party and its candidate, Kim Moon-soo, who is fighting the election in the shadows of the Yoon legacy. This election is being driven more by negativity than positivity. The DPK's main slogan focuses on getting rid of the Yoon legacy, while the PPP is focused on highlighting the legal troubles and other scandals plaguing Lee.

    "description": "“I paint, perhaps, because it takes the place of the words I lack,” wrote Marc Chagall (1887-1985) in 1957, in a letter to French critic Jean Paulhan — a quiet revelation from one of the titans of modern art. The Russian-born French artist’s signature sense of childlike fantasy, rendered in a palette of ripe, saturated colors, has cast its spell across borders for a century. His romantic vista unfurls like a reverie half-remembered: a blotchy medley of embracing couples, blooming bouquets, donkeys, roosters, fiddlers, winged apparitions, fish, mermaids, nymphs, as well as recurring echoes of folklore and Jewish symbolism. Suspended in a gravity-free dreamscape, these motifs rarely appear in their natural hues. Instead, they coalesce in an organically surreal rhythm — artificial in tone, yet inexplicably harmonious. “When Matisse dies,” Picasso once said, “Chagall will be the only painter left who understands what color really is.” Korea has been no exception in its enduring fascination with the modern master, as evidenced by the number of retrospectives and exhibitions h",

    "description": "Korea's presidential candidates have launched online platforms and engaged in short-form video content to woo young, digital-savvy voters. In a nation grappling with deep economic and social divides, the move toward digital campaigning has become a strategic necessity. Online platforms — especially those centered on short-form video — have emerged as critical battlegrounds for engaging young voters, whose growing detachment from traditional politics has made their support more pivotal than ever. The way candidates use these digital tools reveals much about the shifting dynamics of political power in Korea The liberal Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) unveiled a website named “Jae-myung Eottae,” (meaning \"How about Jae-myung\" in Korean) offering videos and other digital content related to candidate Lee Jae-myung and his campaign pledges. The name is a nod to Yeogi Eottae, a popular Korean travel booking platform whose name translates to “How about here?” For many Koreans, it instantly brings to mind the company’s catchy jingle — a memorable advertising tune that has racked",

    "description": "You’d think that as artificial intelligence becomes more advanced, governments would be more interested in making it safer. The opposite seems to be the case. Not long after taking office, the Trump administration scrapped an executive order that pushed tech companies to safety test their AI models, and it also hollowed out a regulatory body that did that testing. The state of California in September 2024 spiked a bill forcing more scrutiny on sophisticated AI models, and the global AI Safety Summit started by the U.K. in 2023 became the “AI Action Summit” earlier this year, seemingly driven by a fear of falling behind on AI. None of this would be so worrying if it weren’t for the fact that AI is showing some bright red flags: behavior described by researchers as self-preserving and deceptive. Just as lawmakers are losing interest in the safety of AI, it is looking more difficult to control.

Voters in their 60s and 70s now make up about 33 percent of the electorate, surpassing the combined 28 percent of those in their 20s (13.1 percent) and 30s (14.9 percent).

Its asymmetry has created inherent vulnerabilities in the alliance’s foundations, vulnerabilities laid bare whenever Washington consideres a new regional strategy or contemplates rebalancing its presence on the peninsula.

Doctors pressed his chest in a desperate attempt to support his breathing. His father brought him too late to a hospital in Somalia 's capital, Mogadishu. The victim of complications related to malnutrition, the boy did not survive. “Are you certain? Did he really die?” the father, Mohamed Ma'ow, asked a doctor, shocked. The death earlier this month at Banadir Hospital captured the agony of a growing number of Somalis who are unable to feed their children — and that of health workers who are seeing hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. support disappear under the Trump administration. The U.S. Agency for International Development once provided 65 percent of Somalia's foreign aid, according to Dr. Abdiqani Sheikh Omar, the former director general of the Ministry of Health and now a government advisor. Now USAID is being dismantled. And in Somalia, dozens of centers treating the hungry are closing. They have been crucial in a cou",

Today, they’re not just back, they’re leading a cultural resurgence that’s capturing international attention. From water-soaked pop parties to genre-blending rock marathons, Korea’s festival scene has grown into a powerful symbol of how live music, local creativity and global ambitions can intersect in one of the fastest-evolving entertainment ecosystems in the world. From local events to global experiences In the past, Korea’s major music festivals were often overshadowed by scripted music shows and tightly controlled idol schedules. But the post-pandemic years have sparked a dramatic shift. Pentaport Rock Festival, Korea’s flagship live music event, drew over 150,000 attendees in 2024, its highest figure ever. Meanwhile, Waterbomb, known for its high-energy mix of K-pop, hip-hop, EDM and high-pressure water cannons, attracted around 200,000 fans across its multi-city run. These festivals are no longer limited to local weekenders. Waterbomb, for example, has e",

From the No. 3 spot in the lineup, Lee batted 2-for-4 in the Giants' 3-1 loss to the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park in Detroit on Monday (local time), raising his batting average from .281 to .285. The seven-game run is tied for the second-longest hitting streak this season for Lee, who enjoyed an eight-game streak from March 29 to April 7. Lee kept the streak with a single off starter Keider Montero in the top of the first inning. After grounding out in the fourth inning, Lee picked up his second hit of the game in the sixth inning with a single against reliever Tyler Holton. Lee grounded out in his final at-bat in the eighth inning. Lee and Wilmer Flores had two hits apiece, but Matt Chapman was the only other Giant to record a hit in this loss. After a sluggish start to the month of May, Lee has shown some signs of life at the plate, batting .346/.414/.423 in his past seven games.

However, companies showed little interest in hiring older people, and most roles available for them were limited to low-paying security or cleaning jobs. Kim noted that warehouse and inventory management positions were considered relatively better options. \"I thought I could put my experience to good use, but the reality was different,\" he said. \"Now I carry boxes for four hours a day at minimum wage. I have no choice because my pension is not enough to make ends meet.\" Korea is a peculiar case, as both the poverty and employment rates for older adults are among the highest in the world.

The bills, that were authored respectively by former justice minister-turned-DPK legislator Park Beom-kye and Rep.

    "description": "SUWON, Gyeonggi Province, and SEOUL — On Monday afternoon, a traditional market in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, drew an unusual crowd: SWAT officers, lawmakers, a former four-star general and even a security agent in a Snoopy T-shirt, eyes sharp and radio pressed to one ear, scanning the area. An hour later, the man everyone had been waiting for appeared behind bulletproof glass: Lee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) and the current front-runner in the June 3 presidential election. “Shall we come together next Tuesday to build a better Korea — a country where the people are truly respected as the rightful holders of power?” Lee said. “Let’s overcome confusion and crisis and move forward hand in hand toward a new nation.” With the snap presidential election just a week away, candidates are in the frantic final phase of their campaigns, crisscrossing the nation to consolidate support. The aspirants are intensifying their efforts, often visiting three or four cities daily in a push to make their ultimate appeals to voters. Lee’",

    "description": "Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung's lawyer on Tuesday denied all charges related to allegations that Lee misused public funds for personal purposes during his term as the governor of Gyeonggi province. The attorney's denial came during the third preparatory hearing of Lee's trial at the Suwon District Court, which the candidate did not attend. Lee is accused of using 106.5 million won ($77,800) from his corporate card and provincial government funds to pay for food and other goods while serving as governor from 2018 to 2021. \"The defendant has not colluded in the crime, nor did he give orders (to do so),\" Lee's lawyer said, claiming the indictment was \"illegal\" as the police had previously decided to not transfer the case to the prosecution. Prosecutors have also indicted Lee's former chief of staff and a former public servant on the same charges. The court, which had initially planned to wrap up preparatory hearings Tuesday, said it will hold an additional hearing July 1 following a request from Lee's lawyer. Lee has denounced the indictment, saying the",

Under this year's theme of \"Innovation for Peace and Prosperity,\" the forum will provide an opportunity for in-depth discussions on complex and multidimensional challenges, from the intensifying strategic competition between the U.S and China and Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine to promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula, among other issues. Also among the key topics are efforts to tackle climate change and the escalating race for technological supremacy. The forum will begin with a world leaders' session, where former U.N.

Kim Hak-joon, from the Department of Korean Cuisine at Jeonju University in North Jeolla Province, received the grand prize for his winning recipe. MFG Korea operates Mad for Garlic, a Korean-style Italian restaurant brand with 41 locations nationwide. In the contest among university students from across the nation, Kim used garlic pickled in doenjang as the key ingredient in his innovative croquette. “My grandfather is from Uiseong County in North Gyeongsang Province, which is known as one of the country’s major garlic-producing regions. Mad for Garlic also uses garlic as a signature ingredient in its dishes,” Kim said during an award ceremony held Friday at the brand’s Times Square branch in Seoul’s Yeongdeungpo District. “So I wanted to create a croquette that combines the flavors of garlic and Korea’s representative traditional sauce, doenjang. I’m glad it turned out well,”",

    "description": "Unionized intracity bus workers in Seoul are set to go on a general strike on Wednesday, as previously warned, as their wage increase negotiations with the management have shown little signs of a compromise. The intracity bus union and management have held rounds of negotiation over a wage hike but failed to narrow their differences, heightening the possibility of a walkout for the second consecutive year. Without a last-minute agreement during their final talks expected on Tuesday, the strike will affect 61 of the capital's 64 intracity bus companies that run about 7,000 buses on 389 routes, causing severe inconvenience to citizens as well as commuters. Unionized bus workers have demanded an 8.2 percent hike in their base pay. But the management has insisted that the labor's proposal will have the effect of raising wages by 25 percent, if regular bonuses are included in the ordinary wage in accordance with the Supreme Court's recent ruling. The union has threatened to stage the general strike from the first buses on Wednesday if no agreement is reached by the previous day. Last year, th",

    "description": "South Korea's business sentiment improved for June, buoyed by a partial easing of U.S.-China trade tensions, but remained in negative territory for the 39th consecutive month, an industry poll showed Tuesday. The business survey index (BSI) of the country's top 600 companies by sales stood at 94.7 for June, up 9.7 points from that of May, according to the monthly poll by the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI). A reading below 100 means pessimists outnumber optimists, while a figure above the benchmark means the opposite. Despite the monthly gain, the index has remained below 100 for 39 consecutive months since April 2022. The BSI for the manufacturing sector came to 96 for June, surging 16.8 points compared with the previous month, while the index for nonmanufacturing was recorded at 93.5. The rebound for the manufacturing BSI was primarily driven by the electronics and telecommunications equipment sector amid the partial easing of global trade uncertainty following a recent tariff agreement between the United States and China. In the non-manufacturing sector, only wholesale and retail",
